            Written by Neil Labute and starring Patrick Ryan '19, Lyndsey Toce '19, <em>A Gaggle of Saints</em> tells the story of a young couple's trip to a party in New York City. The play deals with the nature of hateful acts and those who commit them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This play was the final project of a one-on-one tutorial in directing I undertook with my theater teacher, Laurie Sales, in the winter of my senior year at Groton. I directed these two students in the 40 minute play and then wrote a paper outlining my process and what I learned about directing over the term.

            Written by Mac Gallinson '17 and starring Charlie Hawkings '17, Max Solomon '19, and Carly Bowman '17, <em>A Streak of Lavender</em>  tells the story of a theoretical interaction between a young Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed, a collegue and the center of a historical theory that Lincoln had a male lover before marrying Mary Todd.
        </p>
        <p>
            I directed this play in the spring of my Junior year as part of our school's one-acts festival. I worked with the actors over the course of two months, rehearsing in afternoons after sports and my rehearsals for the mainstage production.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also served as lighting designer for this show and served a supervisory and instructional role in the lighting design for the other six shows put on during the festival that year.

        <p>
            Starring Ethan Woo '16, Adia Fielder '17, Amy Lu '19, Josie Fulton '18, and Malik Gaye '18, <em>The Groton Project</em> was the result of interviews that I conducted with members of my school community who had dealt with issues of mental health in their time on campus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by Tectonic Theater Company's <em>The Laramie Project</em>, the show was an example of documentary or verbatim theater, a technique where found text or interview material is used instead of words constructed by an author.
        </p>
        <p>
            I served as writer, director, and lighting designer for this show as well as a supervisory and instructional role in the lighting design for the other five shows put on during the festival that year.
