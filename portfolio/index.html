            Written by Mac Gallinson '17 and starring Charlie Hawkings '17, Max Solomon '19, and Carly Bowman '17, <em>A Streak of Lavender</em>  tells the story of a theoretical interaction between a young Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed, a collegue and the center of a historical theory that Lincoln had a male lover before marrying Mary Todd.

            I directed this play in the spring of my Junior year as part of our school's one-acts festival. I worked with the actors over the course of two months, rehearsing in afternoons after sports and my rehersals for the mainstage production.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also served as lighting designer for this show and served a supervisory and instructional role in the lighting design for the other six shows put on during the festival that year.

            Starring Ethan Woo '16, Adia Fielder '17, Amy Lu '19, Josie Fulton '18, and Malik Gaye '18, <em>The Groton Project</em> was the result of interviews that I conducted with memebers of my school community who had dealt with issues of mental health in their time on campus.

            Inspired by Tectonic Theater Company's <em>The Laramie Project</em>, the show was an example of documentary or verbatim theater, a technique where found text or interview material is used instead of words constructed by an author.
        </p>
        <p>
            I served as writer, director, and lighting designer for this show as well as a supervisory and instructional role in the lighting design for the other five shows put on during the festival that year.
