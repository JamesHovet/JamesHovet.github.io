1899	Headmaster Peabody invited Booker T. Washington, a freed slave, to speak on campus. Mr. Washington spoke at Groton again in 1905.
1899	The school was a success and the campus we know today was already taking shape: the Schoolhouse, still the hub of Groton’s Circle, was built in 1899, St. John’s Chapel in 1900, and the gym (now the Dining Hall) in 1903.
1904	President Theodore Roosevelt, a close friend and relative by marriage of Endicott Peabody’s, spoke at Groton’s commencement.
1917	Mr. Peabody shepherded the school through World War I: the Groton boys conducted military drills, and wheat was grown right on the Circle to help with the war effort. Many graduates went on to fight in WWI, and several gave their lives.
1920	By 1920, Groton School had grown to about twenty-two faculty members and 180 students, including four children of one particularly prominent parent, President Theodore Roosevelt.

Mr. Peabody, who had officiated at Franklin’s wedding to Eleanor, was invited to all four of FDR’s inaugurations and attended all but the last.1940, Endicott Peabody retired after leading Groton School for fifty-six years. The next headmaster, the Reverend John Crocker (Groton Form of 1918), remained at the helm for twenty-five years.

1965	Mr. Crocker took Groton boys to march with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Boston.

Reverend Bertrand N. Honea, Jr. led the school from 1965 to 1969.
1969	Paul Wright became headmaster and served until 1974; he was the first headmaster who was not a clergyman.
1970	The board designated a coeducation committee, and its proposal was approved by the trustees a year later. The decision was so controversial that the proposal was given a second review, but ultimately reaffirmed.

2015	The newly renovated and expanded Schoolhouse opened. The project integrated the stately original structure—which was virtually unchanged—with a significant expansion that includes the fifty-foot-high Sackett Forum and state-of-the-art science classrooms and laboratories.
